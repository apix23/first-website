<h1>About myself</h1>
<div class="center">
  <p>My name is Alejandro. I'm from Venezuela and I'm currently in Spain, searching for my own path to achieve my goals.</p>

<p>I like programming, I know the basics but I've always wanted to learn more and more. I have to admit that part of that influence comes from movies like <em>Iron Man</em> and the character of Tony Stark... I know, it would probably be impossible to accomplish what Tony Stark did, but I dream of creating an artificial intelligence capable of understanding me and helping me with some of my daily tasks.</p>

<p>I almost forgot! I also really like videogames, to the point that I have become very interested in knowing how they are done, and, why not, creating my videogames. Telling a story as a videogame would be awesome!</p>

<h3>These are my three favorite games:</h3> 
  
<ol>
  <li>God of War Saga</li>
  <br>

</ol>
<p>Finally, I find programming to be very awesome, the way you can use it for your daily use. To think that many people have got so far with just a goal, persistence and perseverance... That is my goal!<br><br>
    
I keep my feet on the ground, and I know I have to start acting in order for my goals to stop being just a dream. For that reason I will learn how to code in many programming languages, I will understand everything it's been a mystery for me so far, and I will work hard to reach my goals. <strong>If you can dream it, you can do it!</strong></p>
